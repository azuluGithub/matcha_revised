<h2> Description </h2>
<p>
  <em>
    This project is about creating a dating website.
    You will need to create an app that allows two potential lovers to meet, from the registration to the final encounter.
    A user will then be able to register, connect, fill his or her profile, search and look into the profile of other users, like them, chat with those that "liked" back.
